=head1 NAME

Tie::DataUUID - tie interface to Data::UUID;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Tie::DataUUID;
  tie my $uuid, "Tie::DataUUID";

  print "A uuid is $uuid, another is $uuid\n"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple tie interface to the B<Data::UUID> module.  Yes, this doesn't
do much - it's just me being to lazy when I have to keep creating
UUIDs from within strings.

To be really totally and utterly lazy you can use the exporting
interface that exports the C<$uuid> variable so you don't even have to
tie things yourself:

  use Tie::DataUUID qw($uuid);
  print "A uuid is $uuid, another is $uuid\n"

In both cases the standard UUID string (that looks like
'E63E9204-9516-11D8-9C9F-AE87831498F6') are produced.

my $datauuid = Data::UUID->new();

  my $class = shift;

  foreach my $args (@_) {
  {
    unless (defined $args && $args eq '$'.'uuid') {
      die qq{"$args" is not exported by the }.__PACKAGE__.qq{ module\n}
    }
    
    my $uuid;
    tie $uuid, $class;
    no strict 'refs';   # about to export symbols
    *{ caller() . "::uuid" } = \$uuid;
    }
  }

  return
}

sub FETCH { return $datauuid->create_str }
