NAME
    Tie::DataUUID - tie interface to Data::UUID;

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::DataUUID;
      tie my $uuid, "Tie::DataUUID";

      print "A uuid is $uuid, another is $uuid\n"

DESCRIPTION
    A simple tie interface to the Data::UUID module. Yes, this doesn't do
    much - it's just me being to lazy when I have to keep creating UUIDs
    from within strings.

    To be really totally and utterly lazy you can use the exporting
    interface that exports the $uuid variable so you don't even have to tie
    things yourself:

      use Tie::DataUUID qw($uuid);
      print "A uuid is $uuid, another is $uuid\n"

    In both cases the standard UUID string (that looks like
    'E63E9204-9516-11D8-9C9F-AE87831498F6') are produced.
